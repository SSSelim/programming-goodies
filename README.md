# Programming Goodies
It was thought that there could be a list in order to make
developers/programmers life easier. Sometimes we just stuck with the same tools
and never look for something new. It is fact that there are some new tools and
technologies coming out almost every day. The idea is to collect and organize
some tools/libraries/technologies so it may be easier to see what is going on
and what other people are using.

* It could be something similar to [free programming
  books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books), however it is for
  different content.
